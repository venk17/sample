  intro:
    "Brand Strategy and Premium Positioning define how a company is perceived, valued, and chosen in the market. For founder-led and mid-market companies, brand is not a logo or a marketing layer. It is the commercial expression of strategic choices.",

  sections: [
    {
      heading: "The Executive Problem",
      content:
        "Many leadership teams feel their company is doing good work but is not rewarded proportionally by the market. They compete on effort rather than advantage, price rather than value, and visibility rather than meaning.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Why This Problem Is Misunderstood",
      content:
        "Brand is often reduced to messaging, design, or awareness campaigns. This leads companies to treat brand as an output rather than a strategic system.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Where Companies Get It Wrong",
      content:
        "Companies attempt to appeal to too many segments, borrow language from competitors, or position themselves around generic claims such as quality, innovation, or service.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Grow Spark Consulting Point of View",
      content:
        "Premium positioning is earned through clarity and restraint. Strong brands are built by deciding who the company is not for, what it will never compete on, and which value dimensions truly matter.",
    },
    {
      heading: "What Transformation Really Looks Like",
      content:
        "Transformation occurs when brand strategy aligns tightly with business strategy. Positioning becomes a decision-making filter rather than a communication exercise.",
